# NLP-Project
This is a project a fellow classmate and I did in our Natural Language Processing course on Spring 2021 in New York University.

The project involved using the Twitter API to gather a csv file of politician's bios, specifically of congressmen and women of both parties.

Using NLP tools, we ran various linear regressions on different parameters, including age, follower count, and district partisan lean.
